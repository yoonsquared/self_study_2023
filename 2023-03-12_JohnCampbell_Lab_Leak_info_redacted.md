Wuhan researchers were importing bat coronaviruses,

had applied for grants to increase their infectiousness

False impression given in journals

We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. 

Bob Seely MP

It’s pathetic

You have this unholy and unethical alliance of scientists working together through highly influential publications effectively to kibosh what may be a scientific truth, 

and get it pushed into the realms of conspiracy theory. 

We need to be asking tough questions about the origins, 

otherwise who knows what virus will be released next,

through incompetence and ambition and how many more millions it will be killing.
 
This is not some political game. We’ve got to find out where this thing came from. 

If you had a virus that suddenly emerged a few hundred yards from Porton Down, this country would never be able to get away with it.

(Or a few miles from Camp Detrick, Maryland)

Anton van der Merwe, professor, molecular immunology

The conflict arises from the fact the researchers perform, and want to continue to perform, precisely the sorts of experiment that make a lab leak much more likely. 

These include gain-of-function experiments, where they investigate whether they can enable, by genetic modification, an animal virus to infect human cells. 

It is argued that this could help us identify potentially dangerous organisms in the wild and so prevent a pandemic. This seems unlikely.
 
What is more likely is that these organisms will infect those doing the experiments, who could unwittingly spread the virus to the community, and possibly the whole world

little justification for doing such experiments, except scientific curiosity and the desire for prestige

House of Representatives

Republicans and Democrats voted, 419 – 0

Require Director of National Intelligence (Avril Haines) to declassify all intelligence

That includes,

activities performed by the Wuhan Institute of Virology with or on behalf of the People’s Liberation Army

coronavirus research or other related activities performed at the Wuhan Institute of Virology prior to the outbreak of Covid-19

WIV workers who got sick

90 days could be allowed after passing a bill

House Permanent Select Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner

The American public deserves answers to every aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic, 

including how this virus was created and specifically, 

whether it was a natural occurrence of was the result of a lab-related event

Dr Robert Redfield

former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

I still believe today that the data indicates that the outbreak of Covid 19 was more likely the result of a lab leak than as a result of a natural spillover event

Representative Greg Murphy

Believes Dr. Anthony Fauci, knew it came from the Wuhan lab and tried to cover it up.

In January of 2020, Dr. Fauci received emails that promulgated that COVID-19 looked engineered and not from the wild,

Yet three weeks later, to save his own skin, he commissioned a scientific paper which ‘debunked’ the lab theory. 

He was academically and intellectually dishonest.

The truth is that Dr. Fauci and his institution funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money to promote dangerous gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology without proper guardrails

Rep. Jim Himes

There’s not one iota of evidence for any of that

(Still wants evidence released)

At every juncture, the People's Republic of China government has obfuscated and obstructed legitimate inquiries and investigations into the origins of the disease

China’s approach has been deeply irresponsible and dangerous to global public health

Mr Hancock

Asked to remove passages from Pandemic Diaries

Questioned the official Chinese version

Simon Case, Cabinet Secretary

Concerns, they would cause problems

could damage national security

Cabinet Office

Entirely coincidental that Covid-19 was discovered close to a Chinese government laboratory.
