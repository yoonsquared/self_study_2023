Pirola, BA.2.86. An asteroid that hangs out by Jupiter

World Health Organization, BA.2.86 a “variant under monitoring”

https://www.gov.uk/government/publica...

First monitoring 14 August 2023, (horizon scanning)

34 amino acid differences compared with BA.2

All in spike protein

https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-virus...

36 amino acid changes compared with the 2023 circulating XBB.1.5

This number of genetic differences, is roughly of the same magnitude as seen between the initial Omicron variant (BA.1) and previous variants, such as Delta (B.1.617.2)

Declared a variant on 18 August 2023

Week beginning 28 August 2023

2 UK sequences found

Denmark, Israel, US, SA, (unlinked)

Precautionary measure taken to protect those most vulnerable from illness during winter following the identification of COVID-19 variant BA.2.86.

Vaccinations are now set to start on 11 September 2023

UKHSA suggests speeding up autumn vaccine programme will deliver greater protection, 

supporting those at greatest risk of severe illness and reducing the potential impact on the NHS.

People in care homes for older people, 

the clinically vulnerable, 

those aged 65 and over, 

health and social care staff, and carers.

Those who fall into higher-risk groups are being encouraged to take up the jab as soon as they’re invited.

Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency, Dame Jenny Harries

As we continue to live with COVID-19 we expect to see new variants emerge.

Thanks to the success of our vaccine programme, we have built strong, broad immune defences against new variants throughout the population.

A variant that's adept at evading immunity would not necessarily take off in a population if it doesn't spread efficiently.

Inherent transmissibility unknown

Transmissibility and severity

Little is yet known about the transmissibility of BA.2.86 or whether it may cause more severe disease, 

but scientists do not expect it to be much different from previous omicron strains currently in circulation.
