- tight junction 유지가 엄청 힘들다**

Alzheimer's BBB that becomes loose.

    - transcytosis 보다는 tight junction에 문제가 더 많을 거다.

    - usually brain tumor cytokines make the tight junction loose.

    - 38 tumor pairs, WES, RNAseq, Array CGH

    - The tumor is very heterogenous.

    - SF, society of neurobioloy.

        - 아무도 안했던건데 MD anderson and UCSF 쪽에서도 같은 해에 같은 연구를 발표.

        - 결국 이 paper 는 reject 되고 MD anderson은 Science에 붙음.

    - Radiology data and mutation retention ratio analysis 추가해서 Cancer Cell 2015년도에 publish.

### Current chemo-radiation could not change the major clones.

    - Distant recurrence accompanies substantial genomic divergence

    - additional biopsy is needed for a distant recurrent tumor

## Precision Neuro-Oncology: We needed more longitudinal samples

    - Wang et al, Nat Genet 2016

    - initial, recurrence, common genes of the tumor was analyzed.

## Comparative data analyssis for individual drug response

    - Lee & Liu et al. Nat Genet 2018.

    - AVATASCAN database: Large scale Pan-cancer drug response
    
        - Rapid chemical screening for 462 PDCs in 14 lineages

    - Tissue, PDC, Consderved analysis.

    - mRNA expression in PDC vs. mRNA expression on Tissue; Spearman correlation???

### pharmacogenmoic analyses of conventional cancer cell-line models

    Gene-Drug Map; resistance sensitive gene-drug association gene-drug map was made.

    PIK3CA pathway in Gastric is more enriched than that of GBM.

    - Zscores for cancer drug response -> check this out.

## Gene-Drug response analysis portal system (Raul Rabadan's Lab)

    - Web-based system allows to share analyzed data for best therapeutic option

    - tumor board and biomarker development

    - possible combination therapeutics

    - Cancer-Drug Explorer (CDX)

    - GENOTREE(?)

## Hurdles in precision Neuro-Oncology Practice by Gene-Drug Screen

- Tumor Heterogeneity

- How to predict the best drugs even in recurrence

- Lack of immune micro-environment

Comparison of Genetic Heterogeneity: Evolutionary scenario by Space-time

    - Nei's genetic distance within the tumors, and recurrence vs. initial.

    - Distant, local, longitudinal metastases.

Spearman correlation of Drug Response vs. Nei's genetic distance

    - metastases 때문에 drugs that could work for that certain tumor is very different.

    - Private alteration에 대한 약 보다 shared 로 했을때 좀 더 잘 들었다. 
    
        - EGFR, FGFR3-TA CC3, PIK3CA/PTEN shared alterations.

- **Root driver alterations have to be targeted**.

    - example of precision oncology practice and limitation

### Nat Gen 2017 (Lee et al)

    - Right tumor and Left tumor 했을때

    - Right cell은 EGFR쪽이라서 잘 됐는데 

    - Left brain Mitotic markers 쪽에서 recurrance.

## Mesenchymal GBM-derived TAM supports in vivo tumor aggressiveness

    - Genome Bio 2020 

        tumor itself 가 아니라 tumor-related cells가 drug effect의 문제를 일으키는 것 이 확인되었음.
    
    - Chen et al, Genome Medicine 2021

        - MARCO expression effect; MARCO knock-in mouse model study is being analyzed.

    **23andME also share the similar idea for the target: MARCO which is scavenger receptor**

Summaries: 700억 투자하여 진행하였고

    - PoC for what kind of data is needed??????

    - Virtual Twin needed for Big Data driven Precision Medicine.

    - Collaboration is needed for such DREAM.

    - License and patents will be share with the collaborators.

## Other cancers

- Lung, Liver, etc.

- MARCO in other cancers also.

- M2 -> M1 transpolarization?

    - M2 macrophage removal is for T-cell augmentation.

    - M2 to M1 is favorable but not that practical.

- CD48 extracted from the bulk-samples and went to sequencing as "immune cells"

    - Were T cell and NK cell signatures found?

## Platforms and analyses

- Spatial Transcriptomics with single cell sequencing -> good way to see 

- Target biology first -> and then immunce checkpoint and drug target study.

- Starting from the bottom is hard, but there are databases and basic platform already made here.

    - IRB is needed for a short-term big data retrieval.

- MARCO from dissociated bulk cell that was sorted.

    -> immune cells only

    -> messenchymal cells only

    -> expression analysis with association to survival

 ### 부사장님 comment

 - Can the heterogeneity within a tumor mass (core vs. periphery) be considered????

    -> TAM cell's distribution study(?)

> MARCO's validation should be easy. IHC staining.

    - Overexpressed in ARDS patients during COVID.
    
    - hypoxic cell 에서 많이 보임. 

    - MARCO and TRAM2 has a few intersecting characteristics. (PIONYR is also doing these two; in preclinical stage)

        - CD200 also interesting.

- The T-cell stage is over and now will be the macrophage stage for the targets.

## target discovery

Pfizer 이 ADC를 다 test 해봄.

Patent review first, and review the trend and direction of the patents with the SABs.

# AVATASCAN

Patent from first find -> first file

NCI-MATCH sets "benchmark of actionability

Functional precision medicine:

    - functional genomics (genetics)

    - functional pharmacogenetics (Drug response data)

PDC PDX from SMC was the largest dataset; and clinical feasibility went up.

Why AVATASCAN?

- DC-cell based testing is needed

## Why functional precision medicine?

    - genome is not enough

    - gliblastoma: >90% success Rate

    - Total Screening to data >2000 patients

    - Turnaround time <10 days

### SMC had high-end machines for screening.

    - JANUS, Automation housing, ECHO liquid Handler (core machine), Envision reader, Platehandler-FLEX, Fiber Optic Illuination system

    - IRB approved by big hospitals in Korea

### Cloud-based big data research collaboration agreement with SMC.

    - currently 1,500 patients

    - 200 a year increase

    - to be 3,000 patients.

    - 3D culture, suspension state. Multi-cellular spheroid.

    - Early tumor isolation -> culture -> screening.

## Gastric and Ovarian cancer

    - microenvironment is a key factor that differentiate sfrom glioblastoma.

## IO drug screening technology

    - next generation IO drug evaluation system

    - CD3+IL2, PD-L1, IAP, TNF-a and other inhibitors that kill turmos with immune cells.

    - Birinapant, Enbrel

    - Proven activity in different PDCs and in vivo efficacy study planned.

### CSO comment

- PBMC and CD3+IL2 cells from different individual will stimulate immune response.

## AI-powered precision medicine 

- Personalized anti-cancer agent selection system based on AI using drug screening and omics data

- From [static] to [changing information]

- Diseases -> Genes -> Drugs (genome-wide mRNA-expression profiles)

- Childhood Cancer Drug Screening Project ["에임드 바이오, 서울대병원 소아암 과제 선정"]

- SK Biopharm, 항암신약 US 임상 1상 돌입. Before the spin-off.

### Precision oncology news

- Partnership with CBmed.

- Step towards collaborations in Europe.

## Drugselect online system

- Drug Screening Report 

- Analysis pipeline -> input csv -> Simple GUI -> pdf report.


### CSO comment

- Plate's well-specific bias -> randomization and multiple screening is necessary.

## AimedBio (Her et.al. 2023 submitted) model
- Drug candidates -> NGS; aimedbio tumor bank/high throughput screening -> AI-based gene-drug analysis -> Positive efficacy drug. [which biomarker, preclinical model, patient group???]

- Screening drugs are 90% FDA approved drugs. Others are PoC with late stage drugs. TOTAL 80 drugs.

- example from thailand

    - foundation one data (genomic testing) and samples sent
        
        -CDK4 inflation

    - drug testing by AVATAMED

        -CDK4 inhibitor found

- AVATAMED = 400 gene panel sequencing (brain tumor-specific data.)

## Business model

- Discovery is within AimedBio and then for development -> **collaboration**

> Discovery license is key for survival.

- ADC component development: one Wuxi CDMO is 250억.

- 현재까지는 discovery license 를 가지고 collaboration으로 처리하여 50~70억정도로 cover 가능 (all within grants and collab with Synaffix [payload and linker] and GeneQuantum)

- importance of payload toxcity over antibody toxicity

- RNA-seq is important but protein level with Western Blot + ETC most important.

### Antibody generation and Affinity engineering

- directed evolution by phage display, mammalian display

- protein engineering and lead optimization 

- in silico prediction using YASARA software

- "Proprietary Candidate" with developability and molecular assessment

## AMB302: Precision ADC treatment strat for GBM

1) fusion oncogene discovery

2) clinically distinct feature

3) Taret validation as a therapeutics

4) oncogene-selective ADC development

> FGR30 alteration 되어있는 이 cancer는 BBB가 degradation 되어있기에 large molecule로 BBB 투과가 힘들지 않을 것

    - GBM 및 Bladder cancer용으로 develop 중.

### targetability of FGFR3

    - Moderate in vitro/in vivo efficacy and cytotoxicity.

### superiority
- Clinicaly Available target : Lilly's **LY3076226** and Rainier Therapeutics **Vofatamab**

- AMB302 is superior over the two drugs.

### GeneQuantum theapeutics collaboration
@AMB009 high affinity, rapid cell internalization and efficient target degradation; recurrence를 막은 케이스가 example while benchmark antibody-TOPO1 had tumor recurrence.

@site-specific conjugation: highly stable and DAR control

@Topo I inhibitor payload (TopoIx): superior to Deruxtecan

    - total DAR = 4

potency가 낮은 linker를 개발 중.

AMB009 에서 human, mouse cross 없고 cyno는 effect 있어서 monkey toxicity 쪽으로 방향 잡음.

> KEY plan: Good antibody -> partnership -> development

FGFR3 for bladder cancer and GBM with FGFR3 overexpression -> no competitors.

Clinical trial plan is made for 2028 

**MERCK is buying everything before IND.**

## AMB001 ADC development

- Anti CD200R

- Found in both CNS and peripheral immune cells

- Atopic Dermatitis heritability

Lilly: LY3454738 phase II study shows no serious adverse effects. Urticaria (500mg IV injection, Q2W)

## Clnical unmet needs

- Atopic dermatitis 36-39% patients showed complete response to Dupixent

- Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps approximately 73% of CRSwNP patients with Asian ethnnicity show non-eosinophilic subtype.

    - western medicine only focus on the eosinophilic subtypes because they are dominant in those regions

- Nasal Polyp ex vivo assay made

    - nasal polyp has very similar mechanism to atopic dermatitis.

    - dexamethasone testing만 하는 한국 CRO대신 nasal polyp 을 research 하기로 함.

**CD200 receptor** chosen because it regulates T-cell and immune cells. From DOK2-related gene (DOK2 is already known as AD-susceptibile gene).

    - CTLA4 하고 very similar profile.

    - CD200R K/I mouse evaluation in progress

    - Vs. Lilly로 best-in-class drug

    - One-source multiple-indication:
        - Atopic dermatitis/Nasal Polyp (Short term)
    
        - Multiple Sclerosis/Stroke (Mid term)
    
        - Parkinson's disease/Alzheimer's disease (Mid/Long term)

> CD200 protects stem cells.

> increase in CD200R results in immune surveillance escape

**if CD200 reduces, immune systems will attack more frequently -> receeding hair**.

## AMB018 Overview

- TREM2 expression is associated with poor prognosis in Brain, Bladder, Pancreatic, Lung cancer

- TAMs mediate immunosuppression in the TME promoting tumor growth and invasion

- Competitor PIONYR: PY314; dev stage phase 1a (NCT04691375) MoA Selective depletion of M2-like TAMs

-checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) added to the bi-specific Ab for the one-source multiple-modality

    - the MoA of monoclonal Ab chosen from T cell/ NK cell activation , TAM depletion and Tumor destruction.

- PD-L1 is highly expressed on both tumor cells and tumor infiltrating leukocytes

    preclinical data reveals functional Fc could enhance the anti-tumor activity of PD-L1 antibodies via the ADCC against the PD-L1 positive immune-suppressive myeloid cells and tumor cells

PD1 보단 PD-L1을 target으로 하고 가기로 한 이유였음.

    - tumor cell and M2 both has PD-L1 receptor sites.

    - tumor cell and M2 bi-binding target.

> 3 approved drugs with PD-L1
```
Roche: Atezolizumab

Merck: Avelumab -> 이걸 쓰기로 구두로 confirm 한 상태임 merck와. 독일 merck와 삼성이 사이가 좋음.

AstraZeneca: Durvalumab
```

    - *bi-specific antibody has a butterfly-shape. Is that okay?*

M2 macrophage may suppress the NK cell activity on the tumor.

    - NK cell is captured by Fc_gammaR

    - M2 macrophage with TREM2

    - PD-L1 captured with the other end of the butter fly.

**가장 중요한건 immune cell 과 tumor cell을 동시에 pull 한다는 것**

- PD1은 ADCC가 없어야하는 항체고 PD-L1은 ADCC가 있어도 되고 없어도 되는 항체.

- 특허 expire date도 PD-L1을 쓸때 좀더 빨랐음.

- PBMC에선 ADCC외에도 **ADCP**가 일어날 수 있다고 생각되며 ADCC assay 보다 PBMC ADCC assay에서 AMB018이펙트가 더 컸음.

- GL261 (brain cancer model) 에서 252.6% 정도의 synergy

- ILS는 % Increased Life Span based on mean days of survival.

## AMB401; ADC Payload Program

### *Duocarmycin (AMB401, PBDs) Brain-specific.
-> high potency but high specificity. No interaction with cell proliferation

    - microtubule-based ADCs don't work well in cells that are not in cell proliferation. Such as Brain.

in silico docking simulation + cysteine engineered Ab => AMB's site-specific ADC (Homogeneity, developability, stability, PK, and safety **UP**)

Genentech's THIOMAB을 어느정도 차용함.

### *Camptothecin (SN38, AMB402)

Structural Optimization with Dr. Ravi

Potency was higher than that of the Dxd, so extra optimization is needed.

## ROR1 study. AMD015 and 501
- CAR-NK and ADC with collaborators.

- MERCK (VLS-101) is the leading anti-ROR1 ADC.

    - Clinical limitation of microtubule inhibitor
