## questions
- Target sequence and Knock-in 주면 done?

- sequence of landing pad, target sequence, and CHO cell

    - can you design the guide RNA and vector for the Knock-In?

    - Landing Pad: keep on going to the same site of integration

- Casette (2000bp) + Hot Spot Candidates will be provided by SBL also

    - About a month to get the constructs from the vendors

    - +2~3 months after that to get single cell clones

    - clone in plasmid or synthesize dsDNA?

        - use plasmid

    - RTX for BXB1 (gateway cloning site)

        - to use RMCE (recom mediated casette exchange) = selection is over 50%

        - length between two BXB1 is 2kb

    - 2*800bp sequence used, so total **3.6kb**

    - 3 candidate hotspots

    - biallele editing -> 2 rounds (?)

        - unless using 2 selection markers (one GFP, one RFP)

    - Is use of AAV possible for DNA template for insertion (mediates really efficient Knock In)

        - use in mouse is pretty beautiful

        - because it is single stranded, it worked beautifully in some cells that do not take in knock-ins with double-stranded plasmid

    - synthetic single strand DNA templates has some kind of secondary structure.... with more than 1kb did not really work better than plasmid.

 - How long would it take for the sequencing and assembly?

    - How to access the data

    - Browser and data availablity

        - connect to the sequencing core GTOC

- Cell culture media with the cell?

    - MERCK media, only product number, cell culture conditions + etc.

## GESC
- Cell line engineering

    - 200+ cancer cell lines (Human, Mouse)

    - stem cells

    - iPSC cell reprogramming

- CHO cell experience yes.

    - stable cell line through random integration

    - cell line evaluation for the homology directed repair

    - CRISPR-mediated works were not done yet

- The rearrangement may affect the editing

- The site may have many copies

   - single cell screening to predict the copy numbers

- MGI -> sequencing is also available.

    - GESC

    - GTAC (genome, scRNAseq, etc.) 

        - Genome Assembly Pipeline (most advanced)

    - Mass Spec Core
